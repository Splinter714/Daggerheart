# Todo List

- in mobile view when tapping an adv or env card and it opens the expanded view, we need some way to get back to the list, either by having the expanded view open in-line to begin with, OR by having a back button of sorts
- countdown trigger buttons - I want them in a single clean tight row in the countdown header, but a row below the countdown title and countdown add

# Completed Items

## Deployment
- Manual deployment working (npm run deploy)
- GitHub Actions requires paid plan - sticking with manual
- Manual deployment is sufficient for development
- Cleaned up unnecessary auto-deployment workflow files
- Cleaned up old test branches

## Issues Fixed
- Issue #1: Filled countdown pips smaller than empty - FIXED
- Issue #2: Implement minion damage mechanics - FIXED
- Issue #3: Delete button for filled countdowns - FIXED
- Fix difficulty badge click functionality - FIXED

## UI Improvements
- move plus buttons for adv/env/count to be just to the right of those words in their headings instead of on the far right of the left column; those buttons should be vertically aligned between those three sections, even though those 3 words aren't the exact same length - COMPLETED
- make countdown creator appear in the header row just to the right of the plus button and all fit there at once - COMPLETED
- countdowns - change simple fear and simple hope to just hope and fear - COMPLETED
pa- countdown cards - make delete button that appears when countdown is full not take place of increment button, but instead appear separately - COMPLETED

## Notes
- Manual deployment works perfectly
- GitHub Actions configured but blocked by billing
- Minion damage mechanics implemented and refined
- Countdown system fully functional
